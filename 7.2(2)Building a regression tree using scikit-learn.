#The dataset contains age and body measurements for a sample of hawks observed near Iowa City, Iowa.

#Initialize the model using the DecisionTreeRegressor() type of regression tree with max_depth of 3 and the random number generator random_state set to rng.

#Fit the model using the fit() method of the model with the correct parameters.

#The code contains all imports, loads the dataset, and prints the tree.
