#Researchers collected measurements from three species of hawks in Iowa.

#Fit the model using the fit() method of the model with the correct training parameters.
#The code imports all the related libraries, loads the dataset, initializes the model, and prints the first and last trees in the forest.

# Import packages and functions
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.tree import export_text  

# Seed random number generator
rng = np.random.RandomState(22)

# Load the dataset
birdOfPrey = pd.read_csv('birdOfPrey_Example.csv') 

# Assign outcome to y and features to X 
y = birdOfPrey['Age']
X = birdOfPrey.drop('Age', axis=1)

# Split dataset into training data and testing data
XTrain, XTest, yTrain, yTest = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=.3, random_state=rng)

# Initialize the model -- random forest classifier
birdOfPreyRFC = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=39, max_features='sqrt', criterion='gini', bootstrap=True, random_state=rng)

# Fit the model with training data

# Your code goes here
birdOfPreyRFC = birdOfPreyRFC.fit(XTrain, yTrain)

# Print first and last random trees generated in the forest
print('First tree:')
print(export_text(birdOfPreyRFC[0], feature_names=X.columns.to_list()))
print('Last tree:')
