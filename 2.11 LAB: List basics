#Given the user inputs, complete a program that does the following tasks:

#Define a list, myList, containing the user inputs myFlower1, myFlower2, and myFlower3 in the same order.
#Define a list, yourList, containing the user inputs yourFlower1 and yourFlower2 in the same order.
#Define a list, ourList, by concatenating myList and yourList.
#Append the user input theirFlower to the end of ourList.
#Replace myFlower2 in ourList with theirFlower.
#Remove the third element of ourList.
