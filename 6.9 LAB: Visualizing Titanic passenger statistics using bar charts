#Load the dataset in titanic.csv as titanic.
#6.9 LAB: Visualizing Titanic passenger statistics using bar charts
#Create a new data frame, firstSouth, by subsetting titanic to include instances where a passenger is in the first class cabin (pclass feature is 1) and boarded from Southampton (embarked feature is S).
#Create a new data frame, secondThird, by subsetting titanic to include instances where a passenger is either in the second (pclass feature is 2) or third class (pclass feature is 3) cabin.
#Create bar charts for the following:
#Passengers in first class who embarked in Southampton grouped by sex
#Passengers in second and third class grouped by survival status
